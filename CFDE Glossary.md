# CFDE Glossary

**ASHG** - American Society of Human Genetics. They hold an annual conference that is the largest human genetics and genomics meeting and exposition in the world.

**Asset** - a sample or a file.

**C2M2**

**CFDE** - Common Fund Data Ecosystem.

**CFDE Asset Manifest** - a collection of **Asset**s described by the **CFDE Asset Specification**.

**CFDE Asset Specification** - defines the set of attributes used to charaterize an **asset**.

**CFDE Common Metadata Format** - specifies a minimal set of attributes (metadata) related to an **asset**

**Controlled Vocabulary**

**Data object** - a region of storage that contains a value or group of values. Each value can be accessed using its identifier or a more complex expression that refers to the object. In addition, each object has a unique data type.

**DATS**

**DERIVA** - Discovery Environment for Relational Information and Versioned Assets. A suite of tools and services that are designed to significantly reduce the overhead and complexity of creating and managing complex, big datasets. DERIVA provides a digital asset management system for scientific data to streamline the acquisition, modeling, management, and sharing of complex, big data, and provides interfaces so that these data can be delivered to diverse external tools for big-data analysis and analytic tools.

**FAIR/FAIRness/FAIRshake**

**Figshare** - an online open access repository where researchers can preserve and share their research outputs, including figures, datasets, images, and videos.

**File**

**Frictionless Data** - shortens the path from data to insight with a collection of specifications and software for the publication, transport, and consumption of data. This kills the cycle of find/improve/share that makes for a dynamic and productive data ecosystem.

**Globus Automate** - a distributed research automation platform that addresses the problem of securely and reliably automating, for many thousands of scientists, sequences of data management tasks that may span locations, storage systems, administrative domains, and timescales, and integrate both mechanical and human inputs.

**GUID** - Globally Unique Identifier.
